# 📘 Collection Tracker (COLLECTION TRACKER HAS BEEN INTEGRATED TO TEMPLEOSRS PLUGIN DIRECTLY SO THIS REPO HAS STOPPED BEING MAINTAINED)

### 💬 In-Game Commands

Use these in public, private, or clan chat:

#### View Your Collection
```text
!col boss
```
_Example: `!col vorkath`_

#### View Another Player's Collection
```text
!col boss playername
```
_Example: `!col zulrah player name`_

#### Minigame and Long Named Bosses
```
!col mini_game 
!col boss_name
```
_Example: `!col general_graardor`_
`!col fishing_trawler`

In contrary to player names that don't need an underscore to function properly, boss names and minigame names have to otherwise they get mistaken for player names.

#### 🔀 Supported Aliases
Commands like `toa`, `tob`, `arma`, `graardor`, `vetion`, etc. are smart-mapped to their full names.

## Known Issues (Pending Fix)

~~- **Player names with spaces:**  
  If your in-game name contains spaces (e.g., `good name` instead of `good_name`), your collection log data may not display correctly.  
  As a temporary workaround, use the command with your name exactly as it appears, including spaces:~~

  ```
  instead of 
  !col boss
  try 
  !col boss good name
  ```

~~- **Aliases for bosses and minigames:**  
  Alias support is coming in the next update. Until then, please use the full name of the boss or minigame with underscores between words. For example:~~

  ```
  !col fishing_trawler
  ```
